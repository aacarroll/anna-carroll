<p>My personal project is going to be an assignment tracker/grade tracker sort
 of thing. In addition to having a calendar "to-do" list sort of layout for
 tracking when assignments are due, you will be able to insert the weights
 for different types of assignments. Upon completion of an assignment, the user can enter that
 grade along with what the assignment is classified as (homework,quiz,test, etc.),
and it will be calculated into a potential class average. There will also be an option to enter "what-if" grades for certain criteria to account for attendance or criteria
 that the user may not know the grades for.     </p>
