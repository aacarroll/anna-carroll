		<h1>Project Description</h1>
			<p>My personal project is going to be an assignment tracker/grade tracker sort
	 		of thing. In addition to having a calendar "to-do" list sort of layout for
	 		tracking when assignments are due, you will be able to insert the weights
	 		for different types of assignments. Upon completion of an assignment, the user can enter that
	 		grade along with what the assignment is classified as (homework,quiz,test, etc.),
			and it will be calculated into a potential class average. There will also be an option to enter "what-if" grades for certain criteria to account for attendance or criteria that the user may not know the grades for. </p>
 		<h1>Main User and Goals</h1>
 			<p>My site's main user will be students looking for a way to keep track of their assignments. The goal will be to provide a straightforward way to keep track of the student's assignments and various due dates for these assignments. This will be presented as a "to-do" list, with the ability to mark an assignment as complete. </p>
