MyStudyLife - This is probably the most well-designed out of all the sites. The layout is pretty and it's fun to use. However, entering in data 
for each class and assignment can be a little tedious and repetitive. Additionally, the subject vs. class differentiation can be a little confusing as well. 

Outlook Web App Calendar - The calendar for Outlook is very generic. You can create appointments and events on the calendar, and this can sometimes be used for tracking assignment due dates or 
tests. However, something more geared towards tracking assignments may be more desirable. 

Schoolbinder.com - This seemed to be the most feature rich. The class creator is straightforward, there is a section for grades, and you can even share your class with another person. It is also possible to upload documents related to the class. However, the layout of the site seems incredibly outdated, and the grey color scheme makes it feel rather mediocre.
